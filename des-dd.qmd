Without randomization $(Z)$, we focus on exploiting:

  - Treated group with **change** in exposure.
  - Comparison group without change.

Recall the potential outcomes framework. We need a substitute population (treated and controls):

$$E[Y^{1}-Y^{0}]=E[Y^{1}|T=1]-E[Y^{0}|T=0]$$

-   Where should we get our counterfactual?

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
    
	% Draw axes
    \draw [<->,thick] (0,3) node (yaxis) [above] {$y$} |- (4,0) node (xaxis) [right] {$time$};

## One-group pretest-posttest design

- Even a single pretest observation provides some improvement over the
    posttest only design.

-   Now we derive a counterfactual prediction from the same group before
    the intervention.

-   Provides weak counterfactual evidence about what would have happened
    in the absence of the program.

    -   We know that $Y_{t-1}$ occurs before $Y_{t}$ (correct temporal
        ordering).

    -   Could be many other reasons apart from the intervention that
        $Y_{t}\neq Y_{t-1}$.

-   Stronger evidence if the outcomes can be reliably predicted and the
    pre-post interval is short.

-   Better still to add a pretest and posttest from a control group.

## Adding pretests for both groups

```{tikz dd3, echo=F, out.width="75%", cache=TRUE, fig.align="center"}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
    
	% Draw axes
    \draw [<->,thick] (0,3) node (yaxis) [above] {$y$} |- (4,0) node (xaxis) [right] {$time$};
	\draw[thick, color=black, dashed] (2,0) coordinate (t0_0) -- (2,3) coordinate (t0_1);
	
	% Legend
	\coordinate (T) at (4.5,2.1);
    \fill[red] (T) circle (1pt) node[right, color=black] {Treated};
	\coordinate (C) at (4.5,1.8);
    \fill[blue] (C) circle (1pt) node[right, color=black] {Control};
	
	% Intervention line
	\draw[thick, -> ] (2.6,2.9) coordinate (t0_0) node[right] {Intervention} -- (2.1,2.9) coordinate (t0_1);

	% Data points
	\coordinate (c0) at (1.5,1.5);
	\fill[blue] (c0) circle (1.5pt);
	\coordinate (t0) at (1.5,1.7);
	\fill[red] (t0) circle (1.5pt);
	\coordinate (c1) at (2.5,1.5);
	\fill[blue] (c1) circle (1.5pt);
	\coordinate (t1) at (2.5,2);
	\fill[red] (t1) circle (1.5pt);

	\draw[thick,color=blue,-] (c0) -- (c1) node[right, align=left] {Control group estimates \\ counterfactual trend};
	\draw[thick,color=red,-] (t0) -- (t1);
	
\end{tikzpicture}
```

## How does this help?

-   Pre/post in control helps resolve this by differencing out any
    **time-invariant** characteristics of both groups.

    -   Many observed factors don't change over the course of an
        intervention (e.g., geography, parents' social class, birth
        cohort).

    -   Any time-invariant *unobserved* factors also won't change over
        intervention period.

    -   We can therefore effectively control for them.

-   Measuring same units before and after a program cancels out any
    effect of all of the characteristics that are unique to that
    observation and that do not change over time.

-   This also has the benefit of canceling out (or controlling for)
    unobserved time-invariant characteristics.

The simplest DD setting:

- Outcomes are observed for units observed in one of two groups:

    - Treated
    - Control

- Outcomes observed in one of two time periods.

    - Before intervention
    - After the intervention.

- Treated: only units in one of the two groups are exposed to a treatment, in the second time period.

- Control: Never observed to be exposed to the treatment.

- The average change over time in the non-exposed (control) group is subtracted from the change over time in the exposed (treatment) group.


- Double differencing removes biases in second period comparisons between the treatment and control group that could result from:

  - Fixed (i.e., non time-varying) differences between those groups.
  - Comparisons over time in the treatment group that could be the result of time trends unrelated to the treatment.

## Difference-in-differences estimates the ATT

-   Our DD model is:
    $Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Treat+\beta_{2}Post+\beta_{3}Treat*Post+\varepsilon$.

    -   we showed that $\beta_{3}$ is the DD estimate in the linear
        model case.

-   In the (possibly counterfactual) absence of intervention, the
    expected outcome is:

    -   $E\left(Y_{i}^{0}|T=1,A=0\right)=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}$

-   In the (possibly counterfactual) presence of intervention, the
    expected outcome is:

    -   $E\left(Y_{i}^{1}|T=1,A=1\right)=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}+\beta_{3}$

-   ATT is the expected difference in $Y_{i}^{1}-Y_{i}^{0}$ for those
    treated in the post-period:

    -   $ATT=E\left(Y^{1}-Y^{0}|T=1\right)=\beta_{3}$

## Extending the model to multiple groups/times
-   The regression model with group and time fixed effects would now look something like this (where $\color{red}{\beta_{5}}$ is the DD estimate where policy=1):

$$Y_{gt}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}g2+\beta_{2}g3+\beta_{3}t2+\beta_{4}t3+\color{red}{\beta_{5}}\color{black}{p_{gt}}+\varepsilon_{st}$$

- Reference categories (for interpreting $\beta_{0}$) are group 1 $(g1)$ and time 1 $(t1)$.

. . . 

- More generally, you could write the basic equation with multiple
    group $(\gamma_{g})$ and time $(\tau_{t})$ fixed effects as:

$$Y_{gt}=\alpha + \gamma_{g} + \tau_{t} + \color{red}{\delta^{DD}} \color{black}{p_{gt}}+\varepsilon_{st}$$
where $\color{red}{\delta^{DD}}$ is the difference-in-differences estimate for groups treated at time t.

Note that our basic regression model assumes the only time-varying
factor is the policy:
$$Y_{gt}=\alpha + \gamma_{g} + \tau_{t} + \color{red}{\delta^{DD}} \color{black}{p_{gt}} + \varepsilon_{gt}$$

What if there are confounders of the decision to change the policy?

We may have omitted important factors that:

  - differ by treatment status.
  - affect the outcome.
  - **are time-varying**, but not affected by the treatment $(TVC)$.

## Adding time-varying covariates

- Suppose the policy is a soft drink tax and the outcome calories consumed (linear).

- We might worry that *changes in* the density of fast food restaurants could be a common cause of both. Now add measured time-varying confounders:

$$Y_{gt}=\alpha + \gamma_{g} + \tau_{t} + \color{red}{\delta^{DD}} \color{black}{p_{gt}}+ \zeta Z_{gt}+\varepsilon_{gt}$$

- where $\zeta Z_{gt}$ is a vector of other controls at the cluster level.

- Important especially if you think other policies may have been implemented simultaneously with treatment.

- Now, conditional on FEs and $\zeta Z_{gt}$, we assume that the timing of the change in policy is as good as random.

## Evaluating impact on inequalities

- Evaluated impact of MA reform on inequalities in hospital admissions.

- Compared MA to nearby states: NY, NJ, PA.

- Intervention "worked": % uninsured halved (12% to 6%) from 2004-06 to 2008-09.

### We want credible counterfactuals

- Strong visual evidence that pre-intervention trends similar in treated and control groups.

- Adds credibility to assumption that post-intervention trends [would have been similar]{.red} in the absence of the intervention.
