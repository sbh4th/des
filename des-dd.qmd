## Thinking about research design

```{r, engine = 'tikz', echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
\begin{tikzpicture}[transform shape]
\tikzset{> = stealth}
    \node (z) at (0,0.5) {$Z$};
    \node (t) at (0,0) {$T$};
    \node (y) at (1,0) {$Y$};
    \node (u) at (0.5, -1) {$U$};

Without randomization $(Z)$, we focus on exploiting:

  - Treated group with **change** in exposure.
  - Comparison group without change.

Recall the potential outcomes framework. We need a substitute population (treated and controls):

$$E[Y^{1}-Y^{0}]=E[Y^{1}|T=1]-E[Y^{0}|T=0]$$

-   Where should we get our counterfactual?

## One-group posttest design with control group

```{tikz dd1, echo=F, out.width="75%", cache=TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
    \draw [<->,thick] (0,3) node (yaxis) [above] {$y$} |- (4,0) node (xaxis) [right] {$time$};
	\draw[thick, color=black, dashed] (2,0) coordinate (t0_0) -- (2,3) coordinate (t0_1);
	\coordinate (T) at (4.5,2.1);
    \fill[red] (T) circle (1pt) node[right, color=black] {Treated};
	\coordinate (C) at (4.5,1.8);
    \fill[blue] (C) circle (1pt) node[right, color=black] {Control};
	
	\draw[thick, -> ] (2.6,2.9) coordinate (t0_0) node[right] {Intervention} -- (2.1,2.9) coordinate (t0_1);

	\coordinate (o1) at (2.5,1.5);
	\fill[blue] (o1) circle (1.5pt);
	\coordinate (o2) at (2.5,2);
	\fill[red] (o2) circle (1.5pt);
	\fill[blue] (o1) circle (1.5pt) node[right] {Is this really a good substitute?};
	
\end{tikzpicture}
```

## One-group pretest-posttest design

```{r, engine = 'tikz', out.width="75%", fig.align = "center"}

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
    
	% Draw axes
    \draw [<->,thick] (0,3) node (yaxis) [above] {$y$} |- (4,0) node (xaxis) [right] {$time$};
	\draw[thick, color=black, dashed] (2,0) coordinate (t0_0) -- (2,3) coordinate (t0_1);
	
	% Legend
	\coordinate (T) at (4.5,2.1);
    \fill[red] (T) circle (1pt) node[right, color=black] {Treated};
	\coordinate (C) at (4.5,1.8);
    \fill[blue] (C) circle (1pt) node[right, color=black] {Control};
	
	% Intervention line
	\draw[thick, -> ] (2.6,2.9) coordinate (t0_0) node[right] {Intervention} -- (2.1,2.9) coordinate (t0_1);

	% Data points
	\coordinate (o1) at (1.5,1.5);
	\fill[red] (o1) circle (1.5pt);
	\coordinate (o2) at (2.5,2);
	\fill[red] (o2) circle (1.5pt);

	\draw[thick,color=red,-] (o1) -- (o2);
	\coordinate (c1) at (2.5,1.5);
	\fill[red] (c1) circle (1.5pt);
	\draw[thick,color=red,dashed,-] (o1) -- (c1) node[right, align=left] {Counterfactual trend based \\ on extrapolation};
	
\end{tikzpicture}
```

## One-group pretest-posttest design

- Even a single pretest observation provides some improvement over the
    posttest only design.

-   Now we derive a counterfactual prediction from the same group before
    the intervention.

-   Provides weak counterfactual evidence about what would have happened
    in the absence of the program.

    -   We know that $Y_{t-1}$ occurs before $Y_{t}$ (correct temporal
        ordering).

    -   Could be many other reasons apart from the intervention that
        $Y_{t}\neq Y_{t-1}$.

-   Stronger evidence if the outcomes can be reliably predicted and the
    pre-post interval is short.

-   Better still to add a pretest and posttest from a control group.

## Adding pretests for both groups

```{tikz dd3, echo=F, out.width="75%", cache=TRUE, fig.align="center"}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
    
	% Draw axes
    \draw [<->,thick] (0,3) node (yaxis) [above] {$y$} |- (4,0) node (xaxis) [right] {$time$};
	\draw[thick, color=black, dashed] (2,0) coordinate (t0_0) -- (2,3) coordinate (t0_1);
	
	% Legend
	\coordinate (T) at (4.5,2.1);
    \fill[red] (T) circle (1pt) node[right, color=black] {Treated};
	\coordinate (C) at (4.5,1.8);
    \fill[blue] (C) circle (1pt) node[right, color=black] {Control};
	
	% Intervention line
	\draw[thick, -> ] (2.6,2.9) coordinate (t0_0) node[right] {Intervention} -- (2.1,2.9) coordinate (t0_1);

	% Data points
	\coordinate (c0) at (1.5,1.5);
	\fill[blue] (c0) circle (1.5pt);
	\coordinate (t0) at (1.5,1.7);
	\fill[red] (t0) circle (1.5pt);
	\coordinate (c1) at (2.5,1.5);
	\fill[blue] (c1) circle (1.5pt);
	\coordinate (t1) at (2.5,2);
	\fill[red] (t1) circle (1.5pt);

	\draw[thick,color=blue,-] (c0) -- (c1) node[right, align=left] {Control group estimates \\ counterfactual trend};
	\draw[thick,color=red,-] (t0) -- (t1);
	
\end{tikzpicture}
```

## How does this help?

-   Pre/post in control helps resolve this by differencing out any
    **time-invariant** characteristics of both groups.

    -   Many observed factors don't change over the course of an
        intervention (e.g., geography, parents' social class, birth
        cohort).

    -   Any time-invariant *unobserved* factors also won't change over
        intervention period.

    -   We can therefore effectively control for them.

-   Measuring same units before and after a program cancels out any
    effect of all of the characteristics that are unique to that
    observation and that do not change over time.

-   This also has the benefit of canceling out (or controlling for)
    unobserved time-invariant characteristics.

- Couldn't randomize.

- Knew Lambeth required to move intake upstream of London *after* 1849.

- SV did not move, and communities were similar in many ways.

- Used SV as an 'unaffected' control community.

- Did not estimate DD parameter, but idea was there.

- Evidence of pre-treatment equivalence between groups:

> "In many cases a single house has a supply different from that on either side. Each company supplies both rich and poor, both large houses and small; there is no difference either in the condition or occupation of the persons receiving the water of the different companies..."

- No knowledge of mechanisms or intervention:

>"divided into two groups without their choice, and, in most cases, without their knowledge"
